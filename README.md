# T2 Ubuntu Kernel

Ubuntu/Mint kernel with Apple T2 patches built-in. This repo will try to keep up with kernel new releases.

**Note for Debian users :-** Since Debian doesn't support the kernels released in this repo, Debian users are suggested to use [this fork](https://github.com/andersfugmann/T2-Debian-Kernel) to get compatible kernels.

This project is closely inspired by mikeeq/mbp-fedora-kernel and marcosfad/mbp-ubuntu-kernel. Thank you @mikeeq and @marcosfad for the scripts and setup.

Special thanks to @Redecorating for the CI.

**If this repo helped you in any way, consider inviting a coffee to the people in the [credits](https://github.com/t2linux/T2-Ubuntu-Kernel#credits) (links given [here](https://wiki.t2linux.org/contribute/)).**

## Pre installation steps

Releases starting from 5.16.2 and 5.15.16 (LTS) have apple-bce and apple-ibridge drivers built-into the kernel. Thus, you may remove the dkms versions of them by running :-

```
sudo rm -r /usr/src/apple-bce*
sudo rm -r /usr/src/apple-ibridge*
sudo rm -r /var/lib/dkms/apple-bce
sudo rm -r /var/lib/dkms/apple-ibridge
```

In case you have used an iso with kernel version **5.8.x or lower**, then the above steps are compulsory.

If you want to install an older kernel (i.e. older than 5.16.2 or 5.15.16 (LTS)), then follow the [DKMS Guide](http://wiki.t2linux.org/guides/dkms/) to uninstall old drivers and get new drivers for the kernels. It is required only once and must be done before installing a kernel from here.

## INSTALLATION

### Using the Kernel Upgrade script

Firstly add the **t2-ubuntu-repo** apt repo :-

```bash
curl -s --compressed "https://adityagarg8.github.io/t2-ubuntu-repo/KEY.gpg" | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/t2-ubuntu-repo.gpg >/dev/null
sudo curl -s --compressed -o /etc/apt/sources.list.d/t2.list "https://adityagarg8.github.io/t2-ubuntu-repo/t2.list"
sudo apt update
```

Then, install the script by running :-

```bash
sudo apt install t2-kernel-script
```

If you want to install the latest LTS kernels, then run this instead :-

```bash
sudo apt install t2-kernel-script-lts
```

Now, whenever you wish to upgrade your kernel, run :-

```bash
update_t2_kernel
```

**Note :-** By default, whenever you run `update_t2_kernel`, the script installs the latest Kernel (LTS or Mainline, depending on your script) as well as preserves the Kernel which is booted during running of the script. Rest all old T2 kernels get removed (self compiled and official Ubuntu Kernels are not affected). In case you wish to remove the Kernel which is booted as well, which may be required which switching to LTS Kernel from Mainline ones, run `update_t2_kernel --remove-current`.

### Download package manually

Download the .deb packages of **linux-headers** and **linux-image** of the kernel you wish to install from the [releases](https://github.com/t2linux/T2-Ubuntu-Kernel/releases) section.

Install **linux-headers** first and then **linux-image** using `apt` and restart your Mac. In case you do not know how to do so, follow the instructions given below. Else you are good to go.

On terminal, type `sudo apt install ` and then drag and drop the **linux-headers** file to the terminal and press enter/return key.

Do the similar process for **linux-images** package.

Restart your Mac.

### Building yourself

Clone the repo using
```bash
git clone https://github.com/t2linux/T2-Ubuntu-Kernel
```

Open a terminal window and run

```bash
cd T2-Ubuntu-Kernel
sudo ./build.sh
```

The kernel shall take around an hour to compile. After that you shall find three .deb packages in `/root/work`.

Install the **linux-headers** package first using `apt`. In case you do not know how to do so, follow the instructions described in the above **The easy way** section. Similarly install the **linux-image** package too.

Restart your Mac.

You may then delete the `/root/work` directory using `sudo rm -r /root/work` to free up space.
